# What is Bootflat?

BOOTFLAT is an open source Flat UI KIT based on Twitter's Bootstrap 3.1.0 CSS framework. It provides a faster, easier and less repetitive way for web developers to create elegant web apps.

Bootflat is built on the foundations of Bootstrap, visioned in a stunning flat design. Bootstrap itself is a trusted, reliable and proven tool for developers. Built with `Sass`.

Bootflat is compatible with the following browsers: `IE8, IE9, IE10, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Chrome`.

Thanks for supporting our framework, and enjoy!

## Features:

### 1. Bootstrap 3.1.0
Bootflat is built on Bootstrap 3.1.0: the sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile-first front-end framework for faster and easier web development.

### 2. HTML5 & CSS3
Bootflat's components are built with HTML5 and CSS3. The pages use `header`, `nav` and `section` to build the layout. Bootflat also comes with several splendid color schemes built-in, and allows for easy customization.

### 3. Lightweight
Bootflat uses lightweight high-function plugins for maximum performance, keeping CSS and JS file sizes down.

### 4. Mobile first
Bootflat is fully responsive, built for mobile-first in mind. It provides off screen navigation, and almost all the widgets are compatible with all screen sizes.
